# Rest API
REST :Represenatational State Transfer
API : Application Programming Interface
Rest API is define as interface that two computer systems use to exchange infromation securely over the internet.
Its core principles:
                    1. client server architecture
                    2. Stateless communication
                    3. Resource Based Interaction
                    4. Uniform Interface
                    5. Cacheable

                

API:
1. it is set of protocols,tools and standards that enables the communication between different software applications
2. It is set of rules that developers can use to build software that communication with another system or application
3. It allows developers to access certain feature or data from an application without needing to undersand the underlying code or infrastructure of that application.



# Stateless REsT API: API which does not store any client -specific data or session information between requests. Each request contains all the necessary information for the server to understand and process the request , without relying on any previous interactions or data

eg. weather forecasting applications.

# Statefull REST API: which maintains state or context information between request. The server store information about the client and uses it to process subsequent request.

eg. online shopping cart
